## Development

1. Update `apiary.apib` with any API changes that need to be implemented.
2. Write tests to cover feature/update. Run them against the apiary.io mock server with your changes. They should pass.
3. Run tests locally. They should fail.
4. Write code to pass local tests (hopefully without needed to change test code). Refactor as needed once tests are passing.
5. Commit to a new feature branch, push, and submit pull-request.
